feat: Implement --layer 0 functionality for expanded-code-collector and split-expanded-bin

This commit introduces the --layer 0 functionality to the expanded-code-collector and split-expanded-bin tools.

- **expanded-code-collector:**
  - Added `layer: Option<u32>` argument to `Args` struct.
  - Implemented `calculate_package_layers` function to determine dependency layers based on `CargoMetadata`'s `resolve` graph.
  - Modified `expander::expand_code` to filter packages based on the provided `layer` argument.
  - Updated `ExpandedFileEntry` to include the calculated `layer`.
  - Corrected `metadata.rs` to accurately reflect the `cargo metadata` JSON structure, including `PackageId`, `Resolve`, and `Node`.

- **split-expanded-bin:**
  - Added `layer: Option<u32>` argument to `Args` struct.
  - Updated `ExpandedFileEntry` struct to include the `layer` field.
  - Modified `main` function to filter `expanded_manifest.expanded_files` based on the `layer` argument.

- **rust-system-composer:**
  - Fixed a destructuring error in `src/main.rs` to correctly handle the 5-element tuple returned by `extract_all_declarations_from_file`.

These changes enable both tools to process only the most fundamental crates (layer 0) when the `--layer 0` argument is provided, facilitating a layered approach to code analysis and generation.
