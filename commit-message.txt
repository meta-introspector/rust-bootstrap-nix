feat(prelude-generator): Implement symbol mapping and declaration layering

This commit introduces significant enhancements to the prelude-generator:

- **SymbolMap Integration:** Integrated a new `SymbolMap` to track and resolve Rust symbols across the codebase. This map is used by the `DeclsVisitor` to populate symbol information.
- **Declaration Layering:** Added a `layer_declarations` function to organize declarations based on their dependencies, enabling a layered processing approach.
- **New Data Structures:** Introduced `ResolvedDependency`, `DeclarationItem`, and `Declaration` structs to comprehensively represent parsed code elements and their interdependencies.
- **Reference Visitor:** Implemented `ReferenceVisitor` to traverse the AST, identify function calls and type references, and update the `SymbolMap` with usage counts.
- **Rust Language Symbols:** Added `rust_lang_symbols.rs` to provide a baseline set of common Rust primitive types, standard library types/modules, and macros for initial `SymbolMap` population.
- **Validation Framework:** Introduced a basic validation framework with `ValidationError` and `DeclarationValidator` trait, though the `DependencyValidator`'s logic is currently a placeholder.
- **New Task File:** Added `tasks/00_00_recreate_rust_compiler_with_lattice.toml` for a new task related to compiler recreation.

These changes lay the groundwork for a more detailed understanding and analysis of Rust code structure and dependencies.
