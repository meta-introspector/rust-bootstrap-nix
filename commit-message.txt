feat: Introduce rust-system-builder for reproducible config.lock generation

This commit introduces `rust-system-builder`, a new micro-composer responsible for generating reproducible `config.lock` files. This addresses the need for a lightweight and robust mechanism to track input file hashes and the builder's binary hash, ensuring content-addressable caching and build reproducibility.

Key changes include:
- **New `rust-system-builder` crate:** A standalone binary for scanning project inputs, hashing them, and hashing itself to produce a `config.lock`.
- **Updated `Makefile`:** Added a `generate-prelude-lock` target to simplify `config.lock` generation for `prelude-generator` using `rust-system-builder`.
- **Updated `README.md`:** Added a new section detailing `rust-system-builder`'s purpose and updated the "Phase I" section to reflect its role in establishing `config.lock` generation.
- **Updated `rust-system-composer`:** Fixed compilation errors related to `config.lock` and `StageOrchestrator` refactoring, preparing it for integration with `rust-system-builder`.
- **New/Updated Tasks:** Created `00_04_integrate_rust_system_builder_into_composer.toml` and updated `00_03_implement_processing_hashes_and_zkp_vision.toml` to reflect progress and next steps.

This is a foundational step towards a more robust and verifiable layered analysis workflow.
