feat: Refactor prelude-generator to use async operations and tokio

This commit refactors the `prelude-generator` crate to leverage asynchronous operations using `tokio`.

Key changes include:
- Updated `PipelineFunctor` trait and its implementations (`InspectFunctor`, `ParseFunctor`, `ExtractUsesFunctor`, `ClassifyUsesFunctor`, `PreprocessFunctor`, `HuggingFaceValidatorFunctor`) to use `async move` blocks and accept a `writer` for asynchronous output.
- Switched from `std::fs` and `std::process` to `tokio::fs` and `tokio::process` for all file and process operations within the pipeline.
- Modified `run_category_pipeline` in `main.rs` to be an `async` function and integrated `tokio::runtime` for execution.
- Updated `run_pipeline`, `run_stage_1_classify`, and `run_stage_2_preprocess` in `pipeline.rs` to be `async` functions and use `tokio::fs` for file operations.
- Added `chrono` and `tokio` dependencies to `prelude-generator/Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`.
- Refactored `use_extractor` module, moving its contents into a new directory `prelude-generator/src/use_extractor/` with `expand_macros_and_parse.rs` and `rustc_info.rs`.
- Updated `standalonex/src/bootstrap/` to use a new `Logger` struct for improved logging.

These changes enhance the `prelude-generator`'s performance and maintainability by adopting modern asynchronous Rust patterns.
