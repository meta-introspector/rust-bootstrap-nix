This document outlines the process for managing declarations within an 8-dimensional (8D) conceptual space.

Initially, all declaration names are hashed to detect potential collisions before file generation. These declarations are then organized into `type/name` directories. We can further process these names by splitting them into sub-words (e.g., from camelCase or snake_case) and mapping them into an 8D chord using an embedding function.

Each declaration is conceptualized as nesting up to 8 parameters or levels within a lattice structure. Most declarations will not share common bases, which naturally forms a group structure. The paths from a base declaration to its leaf-level components will vary, and these paths can be represented as coordinates within the 8D space.

In future stages, string constants will be replaced with references to them. These references will act as "Level 1 users" of "Layer 0 constants," establishing a clear dependency hierarchy. We will also calculate a minimal set of necessary `use` statements (includes) for each generated code unit. An advanced Minizinc solver can then be employed to determine the optimal placement of these declarations, potentially optimizing for factors like file size, access patterns, or dependency minimization.
