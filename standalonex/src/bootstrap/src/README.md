/// Implementation of bootstrap, the Rust build system.
///
/// This module, and its descendants, are the implementation of the Rust build
/// system. Most of this build system is backed by Cargo but the outer layer
/// here serves as the ability to orchestrate calling Cargo, sequencing Cargo
/// builds, building artifacts like LLVM, etc. The goals of bootstrap are:
///
/// * To be an easily understandable, easily extensible, and maintainable build
///   system.
/// * Leverage standard tools in the Rust ecosystem to build the compiler, aka
///   crates.io and Cargo.
/// * A standard interface to build across all platforms, including MSVC
///
/// ## Further information
///
/// More documentation can be found in each respective module below, and you can
/// also check out the `src/bootstrap/README.md` file for more information.
