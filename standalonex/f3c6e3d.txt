+# QA Plan for rust-bootstrap-nix Project
+
+This document outlines the Quality Assurance plan for the `rust-bootstrap-nix` project, focusing on key areas and testing methodologies.
+
+## 1. Identify Key Test Areas:
+
+*   **`bootstrap-config-builder`:**
+    *   Configuration loading, merging, and override logic.
+    *   Precondition checks (`preconditions.rs`).
+    *   `nix-dir` tool functionality (output, filtering, JSON).
+*   **Rust Bootstrap Integration with Nix:**
+    *   Correct reading and utilization of Nix configuration from `ParsedConfig`.
+    *   Accurate execution of Nix commands from Rust (e.g., `nix eval`, `nix build`).
+    *   Successful integration of resolved Nix store paths into the Rust build process.
+    *   Verification of the 8-level bootstrap process.
+*   **Overall Project Build & Test Commands:**
+    *   Functionality of the main `Makefile` targets.
+    *   Correctness of `nix-build` and `nix-shell` commands.
+*   **`devShell` Environment:**
+    *   Ensuring all necessary development tools are available and correctly configured.
+
+## 2. Determine Test Types and Tools:
+
+*   **Unit Tests:** Leverage Rust's built-in `cargo test` for individual functions and modules, especially within `bootstrap-config-builder` and the refactored `standalonex/src/bootstrap/src/lib.rs` components.
+*   **Integration Tests:**
+    *   **Rust-Nix Interaction:** Write Rust tests that call the Nix interaction logic and assert on the outcomes (e.g., correct Nix command execution, valid path resolution).
+    *   **Component Interaction:** Test the flow between `bootstrap-config-builder` and the main Rust bootstrap process.
+*   **System/End-to-End Tests:**
+    *   **Shell Scripts:** Create or enhance existing shell scripts (`test.sh`, `run_bootstrap_test.sh`, etc.) to execute the full bootstrap process and verify the final output (e.g., successful compilation, correct artifacts).
+    *   **Nix Checks:** Use `nix-build --check` and potentially `nix-diff` to ensure flake outputs are consistent and correct.
+*   **Static Analysis & Linting:** Ensure pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) are comprehensive and run regularly. This includes `rustfmt`, `clippy`, and potentially `shellcheck` for shell scripts.
+*   **Documentation Review:** Regularly verify that `docs/` accurately reflects the current state and functionality of the project.
+
+## 3. Proposed Next Steps for Implementation:
+
+*   **Review Existing Tests:** Identify current unit, integration, and system tests.
+*   **Prioritize Test Cases:** Based on the `TODO.md`, focus on critical paths first (e.g., `bootstrap-config-builder` output, core Nix integration).
+*   **Expand Unit Test Coverage:** For new and refactored Rust code.
+*   **Develop Integration Tests:** Specifically for the Rust-Nix interface.
+*   **Enhance End-to-End Scripts:** To cover the full build process and verify outputs.

 # Functional Programming Best Practices and Integration Ideas
 
-This document consolidates various best practices and integration ideas derived from different projects and documentation within the codebase, providing a comprehensive overview of the project's functional programming philosophy and architectural goals.
+This document serves as an index to various best practices and integration ideas derived from different projects and documentation within the codebase. Each section is now a separate Markdown file for better organization and readability.
 
 ## Best Practices Summaries:
 
-### Best Practices in `arrow.rs`
-
-*   **Generics and Traits:** Emphasizes clear type parameterization and separation of concerns using traits (`ArrowTrait`, `CategoryTrait`) for modularity and reusability.
-*   **Shared Ownership & Concurrency:** Extensive use of `Arc` for efficient memory management and `async_trait` with `Send + Sync` bounds for thread-safe asynchronous operations, crucial for graph-like structures.
-*   **Clarity & Maintainability:** Explicit identity arrows, standard trait implementations (`Clone`, `Debug`, `Hash`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`), and `ObjectId` for unique identification enhance clarity and usability.
-*   **Roadmapping:** Strategic use of `todo!()` for future development.
-
-### Best Practices from `CatDB` (core_category.rs, core_finSet.rs, Cargo.toml)
-
-*   **Performance Optimization:** Leverages `rayon` for parallel processing and `dashmap` for concurrent data structures, indicating a strong focus on performance in data-intensive operations.
-*   **Functional Data Transformation:** Employs a `functorize` trait for a functional style of data transformation and filtering, leading to concise and testable code.
-*   **Mathematical Rigor:** Grounds data modeling in ETCS set theory and category theory concepts (e.g., "functor between fibered TABLE categories," "pullback morphisms"), demonstrating a mathematically sound approach.
-*   **Concrete Abstractions:** Provides practical implementations of abstract category theory concepts like `FinSet` (Finite Sets) for `TABLE` computations.
-*   **Domain-Specific Expressiveness:** Uses operator overloading (`ops::Shl` for `FinSet_1` composition) to enhance code expressiveness for specific domain operations.
-
-### Best Practices from `echo` (README.md, Cargo.toml, rmg-core/src/lib.rs, math/mod.rs, math/prng.rs, rmg-ffi/src/lib.rs, rmg-wasm/src/lib.rs, docs/*.md)
-
-*   **Vision-Driven & Deterministic Development:** Emphasizes a clear vision and extreme determinism (BLAKE3 hashing for IDs/snapshots, deterministic PRNGs, floating-point precision) for reproducibility across environments.
-*   **Content-Addressed Storage & Transactional Operations:** Uses hashes for addressing nodes, types, snapshots, and rewrite rules, ensuring data integrity and efficient caching. Implements transactional operations (`begin`, `apply`, `commit`) for graph rewrites to ensure data consistency.
-*   **Monorepo Structure & Interoperability:** Organizes related crates in a monorepo for simplified dependency management and code sharing. Provides FFI and WASM bindings for interoperability with other languages and platforms.
-*   **Comprehensive Documentation & Contribution Guidelines:** Maintains extensive documentation (architecture, decision logs, execution plans) and clear contribution guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`) and a security policy (`SECURITY.md`).
-*   **Git Best Practices (Echo's perspective):** Prioritizes a truthful, distributed history over tidiness by explicitly forbidding `git --force`, `git rebase`, and `git amend`.
-
-### Functional Best Practices: Markdown to Rust Visitor Transformation
-
-*   **Executable Specifications & Code Generation:** Focuses on transforming structured Markdown into executable Rust code, specifically "visitor" implementations for AST analysis. This aims to create executable documentation, reduce drift between spec and implementation, and accelerate development through automated code generation.
-*   **Process Overview:** Involves Markdown parsing, semantic extraction (mapping Markdown elements to Rust constructs), Rust code generation (`syn`, `quote!`), visitor pattern implementation (`syn::visit::Visit`), and integration into the existing code analysis system.
-*   **Metaprogramming & Self-Hosting:** Applies metaprogramming (code that writes code) and self-hosting principles (using the system to generate parts of itself) to automate repetitive coding tasks and bridge design with implementation.
-*   **Challenges:** Acknowledges challenges in handling complex/ambiguous Markdown, semantic ambiguity, bidirectional synchronization, performance, and extensibility.
-
-### Best Practices from `category_theory` (Cargo.toml, lib.rs, compose.rs, identity.rs, error.rs)
-
-*   **Aggressive Linting & Code Quality:** Demonstrates a strong commitment to code quality, safety, and best practices through extensive use of Rust lints (`#![deny(clippy::pedantic, ...)]`, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`).
-*   **Clear Module Structure:** Organizes code into logical modules (`compose`, `error`, `identity`, `shared_consts`) for improved readability and maintainability.
-*   **Generic Functional Utilities:** Promotes reusability and a functional programming style by providing generic `compose` and `identity` functions.
-*   **Detailed Build Profiles:** Shows attention to build optimization for different environments by configuring `profile.dev` and `profile.release` with specific settings.
-
-### Functional Numerical Constants Storage
-
-*   **Functional Object for Numerical Constants:** Describes a functional object (`write_numerical_constants_to_hierarchical_structure`) responsible for organizing numerical constants into a hierarchical directory structure.
-*   **4KB File Blocking:** Uses a `MAX_FILE_SIZE` of 4KB to group constants into manageable file blocks.
-*   **Asynchronous File Operations:** Utilizes `tokio::fs` for asynchronous file creation and writing.
-*   **Code Generation (`quote!`):** Employs the `quote!` macro to convert `syn::ItemConst` into string representations for writing to files.
-
-### Functional String Constants Storage
-
-*   **Functional Object for String Constants:** Describes a functional object (`write_string_constants_to_hierarchical_structure`) responsible for organizing string constants into a hierarchical directory structure, resembling a library, and assigning them to an 8D space.
-*   **4KB File Blocking:** Similar to numerical constants, it uses a `MAX_FILE_SIZE` of 4KB to group constants into manageable file blocks.
-*   **Asynchronous File Operations:** Utilizes `tokio::fs` for asynchronous file creation and writing.
-*   **Code Generation (`quote!`):** Employs the `quote!` macro to convert `syn::ItemConst` into string representations for writing to files.
-*   **8D Embedding Placeholder:** Includes a placeholder comment `// 8D_EMBEDDING: 0` for future integration of 8D embeddings for string constants.

 ## Integration Ideas:
 
-### Integration Ideas from `lattice.md`, `docs/README_flake_lattice.md`, `docs/binaries.md`, and `docs/binaries/prelude-generator.md`
-
-*   **Extreme Modularity ("Lattice of Functions" & "Canonical Form"):** Aims for a codebase where each function/declaration is a distinct, manageable unit. This involves using `rust-decl-splitter` for decomposition, dependency analysis for topological sorting, and enforcing "One External Crate Per Module" to limit external dependencies.
-*   **Automated Management (`generated/` directory):** All transformed code (Rust source, `Cargo.toml`, `flake.nix`) is placed in a `generated/` directory, clearly marking it as automatically managed.
-*   **Rust-Driven Nix Flake Generation ("Flake Lattice"):** Automates the creation and management of Nix flakes using Rust tools like `bootstrap-config-builder` and `flake-template-generator`. The root `flake.nix` consumes these dynamically generated flakes.
-*   **Enhanced Code Analysis & Introspection (`prelude-generator`):** Utilizes `prelude-generator` for macro expansion, AST generation, and `use` statement processing. It emphasizes a multi-stage, functor-based pipeline for `use` statement processing and the "Introspective Rollup Workflow" for instrumentation, report generation, and AI analysis for optimization.
-*   **Clear Documentation:** Stresses the importance of maintaining clear and accessible documentation for all project components, especially for binaries and the evolving flake/function lattice.

+# Current Development Plan
+
+## Recent Progress:
+
+1.  **`prelude-generator` Refactoring & Debugging:**
+    *   Successfully refactored `prelude-generator` to use `pipeline-traits` for core data structures.
+    *   Resolved `tokio` runtime panics and `hf-validator` execution issues, including the "file name too long" error by using hash-based short IDs for temporary project directories.
+    *   Implemented default `config.toml` loading and `--verify-config` argument.
+    *   Successfully ran `prelude-generator` to generate Hugging Face datasets.
+    *   Created `generated/hf_dataset_output/mapping.toml` to map original file paths to their generated short IDs.
+    *   Improved the formatting of the AST Node Type Report for better readability.
+
+2.  **AST Statistics Generation:**
+    *   Implemented statistical analysis of AST nodes from the generated Hugging Face dataset.
+    *   Generated a Rust code file (`generated/ast_statistics.rs`) containing these statistics as a `static` `AstStatistics` struct.
+
+3.  **`ast-stats-crate` Creation:**
+    *   Created a new isolated crate (`generated/crates/ast-stats-crate`) to house the generated `AST_STATISTICS`.
+    *   Configured `ast-stats-crate` to correctly depend on `once_cell` and `pipeline-traits`.
+    *   Successfully built `ast-stats-crate`.
+
+4.  **`pipeline-traits` Refactoring for `Info` Variants:**
+    *   Refactored all `_info.rs` files in `pipeline-traits/src/use_statement_types/` to define `Details` enums with `Info` variants and corresponding `Info` structs.
+    *   Updated `pipeline-traits/src/use_statement_types/mod.rs` and `pipeline-traits/src/lib.rs` to correctly re-export the new traits.
+    *   Updated `prelude-generator/src/prelude_category_pipeline/prelude_category_pipeline_impls/classify_uses_functor.rs` to use the new enum and struct fields with a basic heuristic for classification.
+
+5.  **`rust-system-composer` Refactoring for Per-File Project Generation:**
+    *   Refactored `rust-system-composer` to act as an orchestrator for generating self-contained Rust projects from expanded `.rs` files.
+    *   It now iterates through input `.rs` files, creates a new project directory for each, generates a `Cargo.toml` (including `[workspace]` and `split-expanded-lib` dependency), calls `split_expanded_lib` to extract declarations, writes these declarations to the project's `src/` directory, generates `src/lib.rs` with `pub mod` statements, and updates `Cargo.toml` for `proc-macro = true` if necessary.
+    *   Successfully compiled `rust-system-composer` after addressing `Cargo.toml` content generation and `use` statement issues.
+    *   Successfully generated numerous per-file projects.
+    *   Successfully compiled a sample generated project (`Declaration_project`), confirming the correctness of the generated `Cargo.toml`, `lib.rs`, and extracted declaration files.
+
+6.  **Resolved Compilation Errors and Warnings:**
+    *   Fixed cyclic dependency issues between `prelude-generator` and `ast-stats-crate`.
+    *   Addressed all compilation errors and warnings, including unused imports and dead code.
+
+7.  **Constant Extraction and Documentation:**
+    *   Created `functional_numerical_constants_storage.md` and `functional_string_constants_storage.md` to document the functional objects for numerical and string constant storage.
+    *   Removed the initial helper function implementations for writing numerical and string constants from `prelude-generator/src/main.rs`, moving their conceptual documentation to the new Markdown files.
+    *   Updated `functional.md` to include links to the new constant storage documentation.
+
+8.  **Declaration Grouping and "Gem" Implementation:**
+    *   Began implementation of the "bag of words" and "coordinate grouping" functionality in `prelude-generator`.
+    *   Modified `prelude-generator/src/decls_visitor.rs` and related files to support declaration analysis.
+    *   Introduced `prelude-generator/gems.toml` to define primitive modules (or "gems") for the code lattice.
+    *   Added `prelude-generator/src/gem_parser.rs` to parse the `gems.toml` configuration.
+    *   Added and modified test files and scripts in `standalonex/` to validate the new functionality, producing artifacts like `standalonex/generated_min_decls/` and `standalonex/min_test_project/collected_errors.json`.
+
+## Next Steps:
+
+1.  **Integrate `flake-template-generator` as a library:**
+    *   **Goal:** Generate a `flake.nix` for each project using `flake-template-generator`'s library functionality.
+    *   **Actions:**
+        *   Add `flake-template-generator` as a dependency to `rust-system-composer/Cargo.toml`.
+        *   Identify the relevant public functions in `flake-template-generator` for generating a `flake.nix`.
+        *   Modify `rust-system-composer/src/main.rs` to call these library functions after the Rust project structure is in place. This will involve passing parameters like `project_dir`, `project_name`, and potentially other Nix-specific configurations.
+
+2.  **Define Monadic I/O Traits and Arrow Composition:**
+    *   **Goal:** Create a new crate (e.g., `monadic-io-traits`) that defines generic traits for monadic I/O operations and arrow composition, drawing inspiration from `functional_arrow_best_practices.md`.
+    *   **Actions:**
+        *   Create a new library crate `monadic-io-traits` in the workspace.
+        *   Define traits like `Monad`, `Applicative`, `Functor`, `Arrow`, `Category` (if not already present in `pipeline-traits` or similar).
+        *   Define associated types for input, output, and error handling.
+        *   Implement basic combinators for these traits.
+        *   Add `monadic-io-traits` as a dependency to `rust-system-composer` and potentially to the generated projects if they need to implement these traits.
+
+3.  **Refactor `rust-system-composer` to use Monadic I/O:**
+    *   **Goal:** Modify `rust-system-composer`'s I/O operations (file reading, writing, external command execution) to use the newly defined monadic I/O traits.
+    *   **Actions:**
+        *   Identify I/O-bound operations within `rust-system-composer`.
+        *   Wrap these operations in types that implement the `Monad` or `Arrow` traits.
+        *   Use combinators to compose these I/O operations. This will make `rust-system-composer` itself more robust and functional.
+
+4.  **Generate Projects with Monadic I/O Integration:**
+    *   **Goal:** Ensure that the generated projects can easily integrate with the monadic I/O framework.
+    *   **Actions:**
+        *   Modify the `Cargo.toml` generation in `rust-system-composer` to include `monadic-io-traits` as a dependency for generated projects.
+        *   Potentially generate boilerplate code in `lib.rs` or other files within the generated projects to facilitate the use of monadic I/O for their specific functionalities.
+
+5.  **Refine `split-expanded-lib`'s `get_identifier`:**
+    *   Ensure that `Declaration::get_identifier()` correctly handles all cases, especially those with problematic characters or keywords, to produce valid Rust module names.
+
+6.  **Error Handling and Reporting:**
+    *   Improve error handling and reporting in `rust-system-composer`, especially for issues during file processing or project generation.
+
+7.  **Implement Bag of Words and Coordinate Grouping for Declarations:**
+    *   **Goal:** Enhance `prelude-generator` to collect a "bag of words" (referenced types, functions, external identifiers) for each declaration and group these declarations into "coordinates" (modules) aiming for ~4KB chunks.
+    *   **Actions:**
+        *   Enhanced `DeclsVisitor` to collect referenced types, functions, and external identifiers.
+        *   Introduced a `Declaration` struct to unify declaration representation with associated "bag of words."
+        *   Implement grouping logic to create ~4KB chunks based on declaration dependencies.
+        *   Generate unique module paths for each group.
+        *   Generate a "Canonical Prelude" file with `pub use` statements for all generated group modules.
+        *   Establish a symbol table for primitives and module-based "lattices" to identify new terms.
+
+8.  **Refactor `prelude-generator/src/main.rs`**:
+    *   **Action:** The constant extraction calls have been integrated into `prelude-generator/src/main.rs`.
+    *   **Action:** Split the `main.rs` file into separate functions for processing structs and constants to improve modularity and readability.
+    *   **Action:** Ensure all internal calls within the extracted functions and the `main` function use the `prelude_generator::` prefix where necessary.
+
+9.  **Refine hierarchical directory structure for constants**:
+    *   **Goal:** Enhance the logic within the conceptual `write_numerical_constants_to_hierarchical_structure` and `write_string_constants_to_hierarchical_structure` functions (as documented in Markdown) to create actual sorted, hierarchical directories based on constant properties (e.g., hash, value prefixes), and ensure 4KB file blocking.
+
+10. **Implement global index and 8D embedding for all constants**:
+    *   **Goal:** Develop a mechanism to create a central index (e.g., TOML/JSON) mapping constant names/paths to their 8D coordinates and other metadata, moving beyond the hardcoded 0 for string constants.
+
+11. **Generate TOML report for Bag of Words**:
+    *   **Goal:** Implement the functionality to write the filtered bag of words to a TOML file, including the specified stop words.
+
+12. **Refine `ClassifyUsesFunctor` (after `rust-system-composer` is functional)**:
+    *   **Goal:** Leverage the statistical data from `ast-stats-crate::AST_STATISTICS` to inform and improve the classification logic within `prelude-generator::src::prelude_category_pipeline::prelude_category_pipeline_impls::classify_uses_functor.rs`.
+    *   **Details:**
+        *   Develop more sophisticated logic to analyze each `use` statement (and potentially other AST elements) against the statistical profiles (e.g., common patterns, typical lengths, version information).
+        *   Populate the `git_details`, `nix_details`, `rust_details`, `cargo_details`, `syn_details`, `llvm_details`, and `linux_details` fields of the `UseStatement` struct based on this informed analysis.
+
+13. **Refine `PreprocessFunctor` (if necessary)**:
+    *   Review `PreprocessFunctor` to see if any preprocessing steps can be optimized or informed by the `AST_STATISTICS`.
+
+14. **Utilize Generated Data for Self-Generation**:
+    *   **Goal:** Begin implementing the "Self-Generation" aspect of the `prelude-generator`, as outlined in `bootstrap.md`.
+    *   **Details:** This will involve processing the classified `UseStatement` data (which now includes rich `git_details`, `nix_details`, etc.) to generate new code, configurations, or documentation. The exact nature of this generation will depend on the specific goals of the "better parsing" and "self-hosting" objectives.

-description = "Recent Progress: `prelude-generator` Refactoring & Debugging: Successfully refactored `prelude-generator` to use `pipeline-traits` for core data structures. Resolved `tokio` runtime panics and `hf-validator` execution issues, including the \"file name too long\" error by using hash-based short IDs for temporary project directories. Implemented default `config.toml` loading and `--verify-config` argument. Successfully ran `prelude-generator` to generate Hugging Face datasets. Created `generated/hf_dataset_output/mapping.toml` to map original file paths to their generated short IDs. Improved the formatting of the AST Node Type Report for better readability. AST Statistics Generation: Implemented statistical analysis of AST nodes from the generated Hugging Face dataset. Generated a Rust code file (`generated/ast_statistics.rs`) containing these statistics as a `static` `AstStatistics` struct. `ast-stats-crate` Creation: Created a new isolated crate (`generated/crates/ast-stats-crate`) to house the generated `AST_STATISTICS`. Configured `ast-stats-crate` to correctly depend on `once_cell` and `pipeline-traits`. Successfully built `ast-stats-crate`. `pipeline-traits` Refactoring for `Info` Variants: Refactored all `_info.rs` files in `pipeline-traits/src/use_statement_types/` to define `Details` enums with `Info` variants and corresponding `Info` structs. Updated `pipeline-traits/src/use_statement_types/mod.rs` and `pipeline-traits/src/lib.rs` to correctly re-export the new traits. Updated `prelude-generator/src/prelude_category_pipeline/prelude_category_pipeline_impls/classify_uses_functor.rs` to use the new enum and struct fields with a basic heuristic for classification. `rust-system-composer` Refactoring for Per-File Project Generation: Refactored `rust-system-composer` to act as an orchestrator for generating self-contained Rust projects from expanded `.rs` files. It now iterates through input `.rs` files, creates a new project directory for each, generates a `Cargo.toml` (including `[workspace]` and `split-expanded-lib` dependency), calls `split_expanded_lib` to extract declarations, writes these declarations to the project's `src/` directory, generates `src/lib.rs` with `pub mod` statements, and updates `Cargo.toml` for `proc-macro = true` if necessary. Successfully compiled `rust-system-composer` after addressing `Cargo.toml` content generation and `use` statement issues. Successfully generated numerous per-file projects. Successfully compiled a sample generated project (`Declaration_project`), confirming the correctness of the generated `Cargo.toml`, `lib.rs`, and extracted declaration files. Resolved Compilation Errors and Warnings: Fixed cyclic dependency issues between `prelude-generator` and `ast-stats-crate`. Addressed all compilation errors and warnings, including unused imports and dead code. `split-expanded-lib` Fixes and Project Regeneration: Re-introduced `required_imports` to the `Declaration` struct. Updated `Declaration::new` calls to include `required_imports`. Reinstated `FileMetadata` and its use in `extract_declarations_from_single_file`. Corrected `DeclsVisitor` implementation's structure and `DependencyVisitor` instantiations. Successfully re-ran `make regenerate-generated-projects` without compilation errors or warnings. Constant Extraction and Documentation: Created `functional_numerical_constants_storage.md` and `functional_string_constants_storage.md` to document the functional objects for numerical and string constant storage. Removed the initial helper function implementations for writing numerical and string constants from `prelude-generator/src/main.rs`, moving their conceptual documentation to the new Markdown files. Updated `functional.md` to include links to the new constant storage documentation. Functional Best Practices Review: Reviewed and consolidated functional best practices documentation, synthesizing key principles for modularity, determinism, code generation, and architectural patterns. Declaration Grouping and "Gem" Implementation: Began implementation of the "bag of words" and "coordinate grouping" functionality in `prelude-generator`. Modified `prelude-generator/src/decls_visitor.rs` and related files to support declaration analysis. Introduced `prelude-generator/gems.toml` to define primitive modules (or "gems") for the code lattice. Added `prelude-generator/src/gem_parser.rs` to parse the `gems.toml` configuration. Added and modified test files and scripts in `standalonex/` to validate the new functionality, producing artifacts like `standalonex/generated_min_decls/` and `standalonex/min_test_project/collected_errors.json`."

Resolved Compilation Errors and Warnings: Fixed cyclic dependency issues between `prelude-generator` and `ast-stats-crate`. Addressed all compilation errors and warnings, including unused imports and dead code. `split-expanded-lib` Fixes and Project Regeneration: Re-introduced `required_imports` to the `Declaration` struct. Updated `Declaration::new` calls to include `required_imports`. Reinstated `FileMetadata` and its use in `extract_declarations_from_single_file`. Corrected `DeclsVisitor` implementation's structure and `DependencyVisitor` instantiations. Successfully re-ran `make regenerate-generated-projects` without compilation errors or warnings. Constant Extraction and Documentation: Created `functional_numerical_constants_storage.md` and `functional_string_constants_storage.md` to document the functional objects for numerical and string constant storage. Removed the initial helper function implementations for writing numerical and string constants from `prelude-generator/src/main.rs`, moving their conceptual documentation to the new Markdown files. Updated `functional.md` to include links to the new constant storage documentation. Functional Best Practices Review: Reviewed and consolidated functional best practices documentation, synthesizing key principles for modularity, determinism, code generation, and architectural patterns. Declaration Grouping and "Gem" Implementation: Began implementation of the "bag of words" and "coordinate grouping" functionality in `prelude-generator`. Modified `prelude-generator/src/decls_visitor.rs` and related files to support declaration analysis. Introduced `prelude-generator/gems.toml` to define primitive modules (or "gems") for the code lattice. Added `prelude-generator/src/gem_parser.rs` to parse the `gems.toml` configuration. Added and modified test files and scripts in `standalonex/` to validate the new functionality, producing artifacts like `standalonex/generated_min_decls/` and `standalonex/min_test_project/collected_errors.json`. Next Steps: Refine `split-expanded-lib::get_identifier`: Goal: Improve the `get_identifier` function in `split-expanded-lib` to handle more complex `syn::Item` variants and extract meaningful identifiers consistently. Actions: Review all `syn::Item` variants and ensure `get_identifier` can extract a suitable identifier for each. Consider edge cases like `use` statements, `extern crate`, and complex macro expansions. Ensure the extracted identifier is canonical and useful for downstream processing (e.g., file naming, symbol table generation). Error Handling and Reporting: Goal: Implement robust error handling and reporting mechanisms across `prelude-generator` and `rust-system-composer`. Actions: Define custom error types for each crate, encapsulating specific error conditions. Use `thiserror` or similar crates for ergonomic error handling. Implement centralized error reporting, potentially logging errors to a file or standard error stream with detailed context. Ensure graceful degradation or informative error messages to the user. Integrate `flake-template-generator` as a Library: Goal: Refactor `flake-template-generator` to expose its core functionality as a library, allowing `rust-system-composer` to programmatically generate Nix flake templates. Actions: Move the template generation logic from `flake-template-generator/src/main.rs` into `flake-template-generator/src/lib.rs`. Define a clear API for the library, including functions for generating `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` files based on provided inputs (e.g., project name, dependencies). Update `flake-template-generator/src/main.rs` to use the new library API. Add `flake-template-generator` as a dependency to `rust-system-composer`. Define Monadic I/O Traits and Arrow Composition: Goal: Create a new crate (e.g., `monadic-io-traits`) that defines generic traits for monadic I/O operations and arrow composition, drawing inspiration from `functional_arrow_best_practices.md`. Actions: Create a new library crate `monadic-io-traits` in the workspace. Define traits like `Monad`, `Applicative`, `Functor`, `Arrow`, `Category` (if not already present in `pipeline-traits` or similar). Define associated types for input, output, and error handling. Implement basic combinators for these traits. Add `monadic-io-traits` as a dependency to `rust-system-composer` and potentially to the generated projects if they need to implement these traits. Refactor `rust-system-composer` to use Monadic I/O: Goal: Modify `rust-system-composer`'s I/O operations (file reading, writing, external command execution) to use the newly defined monadic I/O traits. Actions: Identify I/O-bound operations within `rust-system-composer`. Wrap these operations in types that implement the `Monad` or `Arrow` traits. Use combinators to compose these I/O operations. This will make `rust-system-composer` itself more robust and functional. Generate Projects with Monadic I/O Integration: Goal: Ensure that the generated projects can easily integrate with the monadic I/O framework. Actions: Modify the `Cargo.toml` generation in `rust-system-composer` to include `monadic-io-traits` as a dependency for generated projects. Potentially generate boilerplate code in `lib.rs` or other files within the generated projects to facilitate the use of monadic I/O for their specific functionalities. Implement Bag of Words and Coordinate Grouping for Declarations: Goal: Enhance `prelude-generator` to collect a "bag of words" (referenced types, functions, external identifiers) for each declaration and group these declarations into "coordinates" (modules) aiming for ~4KB chunks. Actions: Enhanced `DeclsVisitor` to collect referenced types, functions, and external identifiers. Introduced a `Declaration` struct to unify declaration representation with associated "bag of words." Implement grouping logic to create ~4KB chunks based on declaration dependencies. Generate unique module paths for each group. Generate a "Canonical Prelude" file with `pub use` statements for all generated group modules. Establish a symbol table for primitives and module-based "lattices" to identify new terms. Refactor `prelude-generator/src/main.rs`: Action: The constant extraction calls have been integrated into `prelude-generator/src/main.rs`. Action: Split the `main.rs` file into separate functions for processing structs and constants to improve modularity and readability. Action: Ensure all internal calls within the extracted functions and the `main` function use the `prelude_generator::` prefix where necessary. Refine hierarchical directory structure for constants: Goal: Enhance the logic within the conceptual `write_numerical_constants_to_hierarchical_structure` and `write_string_constants_to_hierarchical_structure` functions (as documented in Markdown) to create actual sorted, hierarchical directories based on constant properties (e.g., hash, value prefixes), and ensure 4KB file blocking. Implement global index and 8D embedding for all constants: Goal: Develop a mechanism to create a central index (e.g., TOML/JSON) mapping constant names/paths to their 8D coordinates and other metadata, moving beyond the hardcoded 0 for string constants. Generate TOML report for Bag of Words: Goal: Implement the functionality to write the filtered bag of words to a TOML file, including the specified stop words. Refine `ClassifyUsesFunctor` (after `rust-system-composer` is functional): Goal: Leverage the statistical data from `ast-stats-crate::AST_STATISTICS` to inform and improve the classification logic within `prelude-generator::src::prelude_category_pipeline::prelude_category_pipeline_impls::classify_uses_functor.rs`. Details: Develop more sophisticated logic to analyze each `use` statement (and potentially other AST elements) against the statistical profiles (e.g., common patterns, typical lengths, version information). Populate the `git_details`, `nix_details`, `rust_details`, `cargo_details`, `syn_details`, `llvm_details`, and `linux_details` fields of the `UseStatement` struct based on this informed analysis. Refine `PreprocessFunctor` (if necessary): Review `PreprocessFunctor` to see if any preprocessing steps can be optimized or informed by the `AST_STATISTICS`. Utilize Generated Data for Self-Generation: Goal: Begin implementing the "Self-Generation" aspect of the `prelude-generator`, as outlined in `bootstrap.md`. Details: This will involve processing the classified `UseStatement` data (which now includes rich `git_details`, `nix_details`, etc.) to generate new code, configurations, or documentation. The exact nature of this generation will depend on the specific goals of the "better parsing" and "self-hosting" objectives."

-title = "QA Plan for rust-bootstrap-nix Project"
-description = "This document outlines the Quality Assurance plan for the `rust-bootstrap-nix` project, focusing on key areas and testing methodologies. Identify Key Test Areas: `bootstrap-config-builder`: Configuration loading, merging, and override logic. Precondition checks (`preconditions.rs`). `nix-dir` tool functionality (output, filtering, JSON). Rust Bootstrap Integration with Nix: Correct reading and utilization of Nix configuration from `ParsedConfig`. Accurate execution of Nix commands from Rust (e.g., `nix eval`, `nix build`). Successful integration of resolved Nix store paths into the Rust build process. Verification of the 8-level bootstrap process. Overall Project Build & Test Commands: Functionality of the main `Makefile` targets. Correctness of `nix-build` and `nix-shell` commands. `devShell` Environment: Ensuring all necessary development tools are available and correctly configured. Determine Test Types and Tools: Unit Tests: Leverage Rust's built-in `cargo test` for individual functions and modules, especially within `bootstrap-config-builder` and the refactored `standalonex/src/bootstrap/src/lib.rs` components. Integration Tests: Rust-Nix Interaction: Write Rust tests that call the Nix interaction logic and assert on the outcomes (e.g., correct Nix command execution, valid path resolution). Component Interaction: Test the flow between `bootstrap-config-builder` and the main Rust bootstrap process. System/End-to-End Tests: Shell Scripts: Create or enhance existing shell scripts (`test.sh`, `run_bootstrap_test.sh`, etc.) to execute the full bootstrap process and verify the final output (e.g., successful compilation, correct artifacts). Nix Checks: Use `nix-build --check` and potentially `nix-diff` to ensure flake outputs are consistent and correct. Static Analysis & Linting: Ensure pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) are comprehensive and run regularly. This includes `rustfmt`, `clippy`, and potentially `shellcheck` for shell scripts. `rust-system-composer` Generated Projects: Successfully compiled generated projects, confirming correctness of generated `Cargo.toml`, `lib.rs`, and extracted declarations. Documentation Review: Regularly verify that `docs/` accurately reflects the current state and functionality of the project. Proposed Next Steps for Implementation: Review Existing Tests: Identify current unit, integration, and system tests. Prioritize Test Cases: Based on the `TODO.md`, focus on critical paths first (e.g., `bootstrap-config-builder` output, core Nix integration). Expand Unit Test Coverage: For new and refactored Rust code. Develop Integration Tests: Specifically for the Rust-Nix interface. Enhance End-to-End Scripts: To cover the full build process and verify outputs."
