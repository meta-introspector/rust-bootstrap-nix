docs: Split README.md into multiple smaller files

This commit splits the large `README.md` file into multiple smaller, more
manageable files in the `docs/` directory. This improves readability and
navigation of the documentation.

The original `README.md` has been removed and its content distributed
across the new `README_*.md` files.
