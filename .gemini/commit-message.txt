feat(config): Refactor bootstrap config generation

This commit refactors the bootstrap configuration generation logic.

- The logic from `configuration-nix/src/main.rs` has been moved to a new, dedicated file `configuration-nix/src/config_generator.rs`.
- The generation strategy is changed from reading environment variables to actively querying Nix for flake input paths using `nix eval`.
- The `configuration-nix` flake is updated to support this new approach.
