feat: Implement category-theory pipeline and introspective rollup workflow

This commit introduces a significant refactoring of the `prelude-generator` to utilize a category-theory-based pipeline for processing `use` statements. This new pipeline enhances modularity, extensibility, and reasoning by modeling stages as functors mapping between different categories of code representation.

Additionally, this commit lays the groundwork for an "Introspective Rollup Workflow" to enable AI-driven analysis and optimization. Key changes include:
- Instrumentation of `rust-decl-splitter` to inject performance measurement calls into function bodies.
- Introduction of the `metrics-reporter` crate to execute instrumented code and generate `rollup_report.md` files with performance metrics and code analysis.
- Integration of a new `HuggingFaceValidatorFunctor` into the `prelude-generator` pipeline for validation.
- Updates to `lattice.md` and new documentation in `braindump.md` and `rollup.md` detailing these architectural changes and workflows.

This refactoring also includes a fix for a `toml` serialization bug in `prelude-generator` related to `PathBuf` types.
