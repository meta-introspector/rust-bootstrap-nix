feat: Integrate split-expanded-bin into prelude-generator and update task workflow

This commit integrates the functionality of `split-expanded-bin` directly into the `prelude-generator` crate.

Key changes include:
- `prelude-generator`:
  - Merged `split-expanded-bin` logic into `prelude-generator/src/command_handlers/split_expanded_bin_handler.rs`.
  - Refactored `extract_declarations_for_composer` to use `DeclarationExtractionArgs` struct for better argument management.
  - Exposed `Declaration` and `ErrorCollection` publicly.
  - Corrected `pub use` statements and function call paths.
- `rust-system-composer`:
  - Updated to use the refactored `prelude-generator` functions and types.
  - Modified `Cargo.toml` to depend on `prelude-generator` and remove `split-expanded-lib`.
  - Adjusted error handling and type conversions for `FileMetadata` fields.
- `tasks/01_09_rebuild_lattice_with_split_dependencies.toml`:
  - Updated status to "IN_QA" and added notes reflecting the integration work.
- `docs/task_states.md`:
  - Created a new document outlining the task state workflow (TODO, IN_PROGRESS, IN_REVIEW, IN_QA, DONE, BLOCKED, ARCHIVED).

This work moves towards a more consolidated and maintainable codebase by centralizing declaration extraction logic.
