feat: Baseline commit before refactoring bootstrap-config-utils

This commit establishes a baseline before commencing the refactoring of
`bootstrap-config-utils` as outlined in `BRAINDUMP5.md`. All current
modifications and newly created files related to the initial stages of
this refactoring are included.

The refactoring aims to make `bootstrap-config-utils` a pure parsing and
configuration preparation crate, returning a `ParsedConfig` struct
independent of `bootstrap` crate types.
