feat: Centralize git command helpers in bootstrap-config-builder

Created `bootstrap-config-builder/src/utils/git_command_helpers.rs` to
centralize generic functions for executing git commands via `std::process::Command`.
This includes `run_git_command` and `output_result`, adapted to use `anyhow::Result`
for better error handling. The `bootstrap-config-builder/src/utils/mod.rs`
was updated to include this new module.

This change aims to reduce potential code duplication and provide a single
point of maintenance for shell-based git operations within the `bootstrap-config-builder` crate.
