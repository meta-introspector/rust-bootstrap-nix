## 5. `flakes/json-processor-flake/flake.nix`

**File Path:** `/flakes/json-processor-flake/flake.nix`

**Description:** This flake is very similar to `flakes/config/flake.nix` but specifically targets the `standalonex` flake within the `rust-bootstrap-nix` repository. Its purpose is to read and process the `xpy_json_output.json` generated by the `standalonex` flake.

**Inputs:**

*   `nixpkgs`: `github:meta-introspector/nixpkgs?ref=feature/CRQ-016-nixify`
    *   Standard `nixpkgs` from `meta-introspector`.
*   `standalonex`: `github:meta-introspector/rust-bootstrap-nix?ref=feature/bootstrap-001&dir=standalonex`
    *   **Self-Reference:** This input directly references the `standalonex` sub-flake within the `rust-bootstrap-nix` repository, specifically pointing to the `feature/bootstrap-001` branch and the `standalonex` directory. This demonstrates how sub-flakes within the same repository can expose their outputs for consumption by other flakes.

**Outputs:**

*   **`packages.aarch64-linux.default`:**
    *   This output creates a derivation named `processed-json-output`.
    *   It reads the `xpy_json_output.json` file from the `standalonex.packages.aarch64-linux.default` (which is the default package output of the `standalonex` flake).
    *   The content of `xpy_json_output.json` is parsed as JSON using `builtins.fromJSON`.
    *   The parsed JSON content is then written to `$out/output.txt` within the derivation.

**Overall Purpose:** This flake serves as a dedicated consumer and processor for the JSON output specifically from the `standalonex` component of the `rust-bootstrap-nix` project. It highlights the modularity of Nix flakes, allowing specific parts of a larger project to expose their outputs for consumption by other flakes.
