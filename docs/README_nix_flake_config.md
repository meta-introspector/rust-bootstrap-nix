## 2. `flakes/config/flake.nix`

**File Path:** `/flakes/config/flake.nix`

**Description:** This flake is designed to read and process JSON output, specifically `xpy_json_output.json`, which is expected to be generated by the `rust-bootstrap-nix` project. It parses this JSON content and makes it available as a Nix package.

**Inputs:**

*   `nixpkgs`: `github:meta-introspector/nixpkgs?ref=feature/CRQ-016-nixify`
    *   Standard `nixpkgs` from `meta-introspector`.
*   `rustBootstrapNix`: `github:meta-introspector/rust-bootstrap-nix?ref=feature/bootstrap-001`
    *   **Self-Reference:** This input refers to the main `rust-bootstrap-nix` repository itself, specifically pointing to the `feature/bootstrap-001` branch. This establishes a dependency on the outputs of the main project's flake.

**Outputs:**

*   **`packages.aarch64-linux.default`:**
    *   This output creates a derivation named `processed-json-output`.
    *   It reads the `xpy_json_output.json` file from the `rustBootstrapNix.packages.aarch64-linux.default` (which is the `sccache`-enabled Rust compiler package from the root flake).
    *   The content of `xpy_json_output.json` is parsed as JSON using `builtins.fromJSON`.
    *   The parsed JSON content is then written to `$out/output.txt` within the derivation.

**Overall Purpose:** This flake acts as a consumer of the `xpy_json_output.json` file produced by the main `rust-bootstrap-nix` build process. It allows for the structured consumption and further processing of this JSON data within the Nix ecosystem.
