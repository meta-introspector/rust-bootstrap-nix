# rust-bootstrap-nix

This repository provides a Nix-based development and build environment for Rust projects, with a focus on integrating `sccache` for accelerated compilation and managing the `x.py` build system. It includes various Nix flakes for environment setup, JSON output processing, and build command evaluation, alongside shell scripts for debugging, development, and testing.

## Key Features

*   **Reproducible Development Environments:** Utilizes Nix flakes to define consistent Python and Rust development shells.
*   **`sccache` Integration:** Accelerates Rust compilation through `sccache` caching.
*   **`x.py` Build System Support:** Provides tools and environments for working with the `x.py` build orchestration script.
*   **JSON Output Processing:** Includes flakes for capturing and analyzing JSON metadata generated by the build process.
