description = "Implement logic to generate a formal specification (in Rust Doc format) for a function's input/output category transformation. Additionally, if a `SynError` was recorded during parsing, generate an updated heuristic for the `ClassifyUsesFunctor` to resolve this parsing failure, referencing relevant `AST_STATISTICS` data points."
