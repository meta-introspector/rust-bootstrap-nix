title = "Refactor `rust-system-composer` to use Monadic I/O"
description = "Goal: Modify `rust-system-composer`'s I/O operations (file reading, writing, external command execution) to use the newly defined monadic I/O traits. Actions: Identify I/O-bound operations within `rust-system-composer`. Wrap these operations in types that implement the `Monad` or `Arrow` traits. Use combinators to compose these I/O operations. This will make `rust-system-composer` itself more robust and functional."
