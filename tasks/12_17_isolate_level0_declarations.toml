description = "Complete the extraction of Level 0 Declarations (atomic units without internal dependencies, starting with `const` items). These must be placed in their own isolated, self-contained files and modules within the `generated_declarations/0/` directory. Level 0 elements form the base of the topologically sorted Lattice, enabling layered compilation and dependency verification."
