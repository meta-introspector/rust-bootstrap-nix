description = "Address and resolve immediate compilation errors in the `prelude-generator` crate, specifically those stemming from type mismatches (e.g., 5-element tuple return, `RustcInfo` conversion) introduced by changes to `split-expanded-lib` or module refactoring. This is a critical P1 task to restore project stability."
