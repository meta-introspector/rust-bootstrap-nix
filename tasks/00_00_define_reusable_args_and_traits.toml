# This task defines the architectural change to formalize the project's vocabulary,
# configuration, and file layout using traits and reusable argument structs.

[task]
name = "Define Reusable Args Structs and Traits"
description = """
Implement a standardized approach for command-line arguments and configuration entries
across the project. This involves:

1.  **Defining a `IsRunnable` trait:** This trait will encapsulate dry-run functionality,
    allowing any command or subcommand to consistently report its intended actions
    without execution.
2.  **Creating reusable `Args` structs:** Extract common argument patterns (e.g.,
    `config_file_path`, `project_root`, `output_path`) into reusable structs.
    These structs will be composed into larger command-specific argument structures.
3.  **Abstracting configuration entries:** Define traits and structs for common
    `config.toml` entries to ensure consistency and reusability.
4.  **Abstracting file paths and generated output:** Introduce generic traits for
    handling file paths and representing generated code or data, promoting
    flexibility and testability.

This task aims to improve code modularity, reduce duplication, and enhance the
maintainability and extensibility of the project's command-line interface and
configuration system.
