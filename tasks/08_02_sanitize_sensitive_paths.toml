title = "Sanitize sensitive paths in logs and reports"
description = "Implement sanitization for environment logs and reports by redacting or substituting local/absolute paths (e.g., `$HOME`, `$CARGO_HOME`, Nix store paths) with generalized placeholders. This prevents the leakage of environment-specific context into shared artifacts, AI analysis reports, and version control."
