title = "Constant Extraction and Documentation"
description = "Created `functional_numerical_constants_storage.md` and `functional_string_constants_storage.md` to document the functional objects for numerical and string constant storage. Removed the initial helper function implementations for writing numerical and string constants from `prelude-generator/src/main.rs`, moving their conceptual documentation to the new Markdown files. Updated `functional.md` to include links to the new constant storage documentation."
