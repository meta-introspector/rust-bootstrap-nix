title = "Analyze and Report on Enum Extension Lattice"
description = "Implement functionality to analyze and report on the evolutionary nature of enums, particularly within an AST or complex system. This task focuses on identifying a 'core set' of enum items and then mapping how the enum type is extended into new spaces, forming a 'lattice of extensions'. The analysis should highlight the dependencies and relationships between the core and extended enum variants, providing insights into the growth and modularity of the system. This builds upon the concepts outlined in `Lattice_Analysis_for_Large_Types.md` and the sub-lattice framework."
