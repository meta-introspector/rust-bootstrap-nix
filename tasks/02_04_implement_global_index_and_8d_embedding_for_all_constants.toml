description = "This step takes the raw Level 0 declarations from Step 3 and **maps them into the 8-dimensional conceptual space**. This creates a central index (e.g., TOML/JSON) linking constant names/paths to their canonical **8D coordinates**, moving beyond hardcoded values and formally defining their verifiable position within the lattice."
