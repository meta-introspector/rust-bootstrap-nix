description = "Review Existing Tests: Identify current unit, integration, and system tests. Prioritize Test Cases: Based on the `TODO.md`, focus on critical paths first (e.g., `bootstrap-config-builder` output, core Nix integration). Expand Unit Test Coverage: For new and refactored Rust code. Develop Integration Tests: Specifically for the Rust-Nix interface. Enhance End-to-End Scripts: To cover the full build process and verify outputs."
