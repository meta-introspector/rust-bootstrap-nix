title = "Refine ClassifyUsesFunctor (after rust-system-composer is functional)"
description = "Leverage the statistical data from `ast-stats-crate::AST_STATISTICS` (Data-Driven Self-Improvement) to inform and improve the classification logic within `prelude-generator::src::prelude_category_pipeline::prelude_category_pipeline_impls::classify_uses_functor.rs`. Develop more sophisticated logic to analyze each `use` statement (and potentially other AST elements) against the statistical profiles (e.g., common patterns, typical lengths, version information). Populate the `git_details`, `nix_details`, `rust_details`, `cargo_details`, `syn_details`, `llvm_details`, and `linux_details` fields of the `UseStatement` struct based on this informed analysis."
