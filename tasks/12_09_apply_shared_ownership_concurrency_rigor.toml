description = "Ensure all shared, graph-like, or global data structures utilize `Arc` (Atomic Reference Counting) and explicitly constrain generic type parameters with `Send + Sync` bounds. This adheres to best practices for thread safety and memory efficiency, especially for complex graph analysis and asynchronous operations using `tokio`."
