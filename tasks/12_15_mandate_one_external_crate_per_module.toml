description = "Enforce the 'One External Crate Per Module' (OECPM) architectural constraint. As code is broken down by `rust-decl-splitter`, ensure that newly created modules adhere to this rule. If a declaration relies on two external crates, it must be refactored into two or more dependent functions/types, each contained in a separate module wrapper."
