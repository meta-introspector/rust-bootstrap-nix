title = "Break down monolithic functions in prelude-generator"
description = "Break down monolithic functions within `prelude-generator` (e.g., functors like `HuggingFaceValidatorFunctor`, `expand_macros_and_parse`) into smaller, more focused units. This adheres to the principle of 'extreme modularity' and facilitates their representation as nodes in the Lattice of Functions."
