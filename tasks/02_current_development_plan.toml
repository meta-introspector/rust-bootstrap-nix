description = "Recent Progress: `prelude-generator` Refactoring & Debugging: Successfully refactored `prelude-generator` to use `pipeline-traits` for core data structures. Resolved `tokio` runtime panics and `hf-validator` execution issues, including the \"file name too long\" error by using hash-based short IDs for temporary project directories. Implemented default `config.toml` loading and `--verify-config` argument. Successfully ran `prelude-generator` to generate Hugging Face datasets. Created `generated/hf_dataset_output/mapping.toml` to map original file paths to their generated short IDs. Improved the formatting of the AST Node Type Report for better readability. AST Statistics Generation: Implemented statistical analysis of AST nodes from the generated Hugging Face dataset. Generated a Rust code file (`generated/ast_statistics.rs`) containing these statistics as a `static` `AstStatistics` struct. `ast-stats-crate` Creation: Created a new isolated crate (`generated/crates/ast-stats-crate`) to house the generated `AST_STATISTICS`. Configured `ast-stats-crate` to correctly depend on `once_cell` and `pipeline-traits`. Successfully built `ast-stats-crate`. `pipeline-traits` Refactoring for `Info` Variants: Refactored all `_info.rs` files in `pipeline-traits/src/use_statement_types/` to define `Details` enums with `Info` variants and corresponding `Info` structs. Updated `pipeline-traits/src/use_statement_types/mod.rs` and `pipeline-traits/src/lib.rs` to correctly re-export the new traits. Updated `prelude-generator/src/prelude_category_pipeline/prelude_category_pipeline_impls/classify_uses_functor.rs` to use the new enum and struct fields with a basic heuristic for classification. `rust-system-composer` Refactoring for Per-File Project Generation: Refactored `rust-system-composer` to act as an orchestrator for generating self-contained Rust projects from expanded `.rs` files. It now iterates through input `.rs` files, creates a new project directory for each, generates a `Cargo.toml` (including `[workspace]` and `split-expanded-lib` dependency), calls `split_expanded_lib` to extract declarations, writes these declarations to the project's `src/` directory, generates `src/lib.rs` with `pub mod` statements, and updates `Cargo.toml` for `proc-macro = true` if necessary. Successfully compiled `rust-system-composer` after addressing `Cargo.toml` content generation and `use` statement issues. Successfully generated numerous per-file projects. Successfully compiled a sample generated project (`Declaration_project`), confirming the correctness of the generated `Cargo.toml`, `lib.rs`, and extracted declaration files. Resolved Compilation Errors and Warnings: Fixed cyclic dependency issues between `prelude-generator` and `ast-stats-crate`. Addressed all compilation errors and warnings, including unused imports and dead code. `split-expanded-lib` Fixes and Project Regeneration: Re-introduced `required_imports` to the `Declaration` struct. Updated `Declaration::new` calls to include `required_imports`. Reinstated `FileMetadata` and its use in `extract_declarations_from_single_file`. Corrected `DeclsVisitor` implementation's structure and `DependencyVisitor` instantiations. Successfully re-ran `make regenerate-generated-projects` without compilation errors or warnings. Constant Extraction and Documentation: Created `functional_numerical_constants_storage.md` and `functional_string_constants_storage.md` to document the functional objects for numerical and string constant storage. Removed the initial helper function implementations for writing numerical and string constants from `prelude-generator/src/main.rs`, moving their conceptual documentation to the new Markdown files. Updated `functional.md` to include links to the new constant storage documentation. Functional Best Practices Review: Reviewed and consolidated functional best practices documentation, synthesizing key principles for modularity, determinism, code generation, and architectural patterns. Declaration Grouping and "Gem" Implementation: Began implementation of the "bag of words" and "coordinate grouping" functionality in `prelude-generator`. Modified `prelude-generator/src/decls_visitor.rs` and related files to support declaration analysis. Introduced `prelude-generator/gems.toml` to define primitive modules (or "gems") for the code lattice. Added `prelude-generator/src/gem_parser.rs` to parse the `gems.toml` configuration. Added and modified test files and scripts in `standalonex/` to validate the new functionality, producing artifacts like `standalonex/generated_min_decls/` and `standalonex/min_test_project/collected_errors.json`. Next Steps: Refine `split-expanded-lib::get_identifier`: Goal: Improve the `get_identifier` function in `split-expanded-lib` to handle more complex `syn::Item` variants and extract meaningful identifiers consistently. Actions: Review all `syn::Item` variants and ensure `get_identifier` can extract a suitable identifier for each. Consider edge cases like `use` statements, `extern crate`, and complex macro expansions. Ensure the extracted identifier is canonical and useful for downstream processing (e.g., file naming, symbol table generation). Error Handling and Reporting: Goal: Implement robust error handling and reporting mechanisms across `prelude-generator` and `rust-system-composer`. Actions: Define custom error types for each crate, encapsulating specific error conditions. Use `thiserror` or similar crates for ergonomic error handling. Implement centralized error reporting, potentially logging errors to a file or standard error stream with detailed context. Ensure graceful degradation or informative error messages to the user. Integrate `flake-template-generator` as a Library: Goal: Refactor `flake-template-generator` to expose its core functionality as a library, allowing `rust-system-composer` to programmatically generate Nix flake templates. Actions: Move the template generation logic from `flake-template-generator/src/main.rs` into `flake-template-generator/src/lib.rs`. Define a clear API for the library, including functions for generating `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` files based on provided inputs (e.g., project name, dependencies). Update `flake-template-generator/src/main.rs` to use the new library API. Add `flake-template-generator` as a dependency to `rust-system-composer`. Define Monadic I/O Traits and Arrow Composition: Goal: Create a new crate (e.g., `monadic-io-traits`) that defines generic traits for monadic I/O operations and arrow composition, drawing inspiration from `functional_arrow_best_practices.md`. Actions: Create a new library crate `monadic-io-traits` in the workspace. Define traits like `Monad`, `Applicative`, `Functor`, `Arrow`, `Category` (if not already present in `pipeline-traits` or similar). Define associated types for input, output, and error handling. Implement basic combinators for these traits. Add `monadic-io-traits` as a dependency to `rust-system-composer` and potentially to the generated projects if they need to implement these traits. Refactor `rust-system-composer` to use Monadic I/O: Goal: Modify `rust-system-composer`'s I/O operations (file reading, writing, external command execution) to use the newly defined monadic I/O traits. Actions: Identify I/O-bound operations within `rust-system-composer`. Wrap these operations in types that implement the `Monad` or `Arrow` traits. Use combinators to compose these I/O operations. This will make `rust-system-composer` itself more robust and functional. Generate Projects with Monadic I/O Integration: Goal: Ensure that the generated projects can easily integrate with the monadic I/O framework. Actions: Modify the `Cargo.toml` generation in `rust-system-composer` to include `monadic-io-traits` as a dependency for generated projects. Potentially generate boilerplate code in `lib.rs` or other files within the generated projects to facilitate the use of monadic I/O for their specific functionalities. Implement Bag of Words and Coordinate Grouping for Declarations: Goal: Enhance `prelude-generator` to collect a "bag of words" (referenced types, functions, external identifiers) for each declaration and group these declarations into "coordinates" (modules) aiming for ~4KB chunks. Actions: Enhanced `DeclsVisitor` to collect referenced types, functions, and external identifiers. Introduced a `Declaration` struct to unify declaration representation with associated "bag of words." Implement grouping logic to create ~4KB chunks based on declaration dependencies. Generate unique module paths for each group. Generate a "Canonical Prelude" file with `pub use` statements for all generated group modules. Establish a symbol table for primitives and module-based "lattices" to identify new terms. Refactor `prelude-generator/src/main.rs`: Action: The constant extraction calls have been integrated into `prelude-generator/src/main.rs`. Action: Split the `main.rs` file into separate functions for processing structs and constants to improve modularity and readability. Action: Ensure all internal calls within the extracted functions and the `main` function use the `prelude_generator::` prefix where necessary. Refine hierarchical directory structure for constants: Goal: Enhance the logic within the conceptual `write_numerical_constants_to_hierarchical_structure` and `write_string_constants_to_hierarchical_structure` functions (as documented in Markdown) to create actual sorted, hierarchical directories based on constant properties (e.g., hash, value prefixes), and ensure 4KB file blocking. Implement global index and 8D embedding for all constants: Goal: Develop a mechanism to create a central index (e.g., TOML/JSON) mapping constant names/paths to their 8D coordinates and other metadata, moving beyond the hardcoded 0 for string constants. Generate TOML report for Bag of Words: Goal: Implement the functionality to write the filtered bag of words to a TOML file, including the specified stop words. Refine `ClassifyUsesFunctor` (after `rust-system-composer` is functional): Goal: Leverage the statistical data from `ast-stats-crate::AST_STATISTICS` to inform and improve the classification logic within `prelude-generator::src::prelude_category_pipeline::prelude_category_pipeline_impls::classify_uses_functor.rs`. Details: Develop more sophisticated logic to analyze each `use` statement (and potentially other AST elements) against the statistical profiles (e.g., common patterns, typical lengths, version information). Populate the `git_details`, `nix_details`, `rust_details`, `cargo_details`, `syn_details`, `llvm_details`, and `linux_details` fields of the `UseStatement` struct based on this informed analysis. Refine `PreprocessFunctor` (if necessary): Review `PreprocessFunctor` to see if any preprocessing steps can be optimized or informed by the `AST_STATISTICS`. Utilize Generated Data for Self-Generation: Goal: Begin implementing the "Self-Generation" aspect of the `prelude-generator`, as outlined in `bootstrap.md`. Details: This will involve processing the classified `UseStatement` data (which now includes rich `git_details`, `nix_details`, etc.) to generate new code, configurations, or documentation. The exact nature of this generation will depend on the specific goals of the "better parsing" and "self-hosting" objectives."
