description = "Finish migrating all remaining logic from large, central library files (e.g., the conceptual `bootstrap-config-builder-core/src/lib.rs` and `standalonex/src/bootstrap/src/lib.rs`) into smaller, topographically defined modules. This resolves immediate import issues and ensures the separation of concerns necessary for the Lattice."
