description = "The constant extraction calls have been integrated into `prelude-generator/src/main.rs`. Split the `main.rs` file into separate functions for processing structs and constants to improve modularity and readability. Ensure all internal calls within the extracted functions and the `main` function use the `prelude_generator::` prefix where necessary."
