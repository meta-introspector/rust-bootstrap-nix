title = "Implement Bag of Words and Coordinate Grouping for Declarations"
description = "Immediately implement the logic to enhance `DeclsVisitor` to collect the \"bag of words\" (all referenced identifiers, types, and external items) for each declaration (`syn::Item`). Store this BoW within the generic `Declaration` struct. This is the foundation for calculating the **8D embedding/coordinate** of the declaration, defining its position within the lattice structure for optimal grouping (e.g., into **~4KB chunks**)."
