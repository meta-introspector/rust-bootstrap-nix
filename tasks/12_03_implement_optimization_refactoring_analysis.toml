title = "Implement Optimization & Refactoring Analysis"
description = "Implement logic to analyze runtime performance metrics (duration, call count from `rollup_report.md`) and the complexity of `syn` usage within a function. Based on this analysis, identify the most costly blocks or external dependency calls and propose refactoring strategies (e.g., breaking down monolithic functors, optimizing macro usage) that align with the Monadic I/O traits objective."
