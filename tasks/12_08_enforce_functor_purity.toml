title = "Enforce Functor Purity and I/O Isolation"
description = "Refactor `PipelineFunctor::map` implementations to strictly limit logic to mathematical transformations between input and output categories. All heavy side-effects (file writing, network calls) must be deferred or encapsulated by the Monadic I/O Trait, aligning with functional functor purity and preventing monolithic functors."
