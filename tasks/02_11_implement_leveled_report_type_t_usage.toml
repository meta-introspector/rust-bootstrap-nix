title = "Implement Leveled Report for Type T Usage by Other Type Count"
description = "Implement a specialized leveled report that analyzes the usage of a specific `type T` within unique expressions up to a defined depth N. The report should categorize and present the usage based on the number of *other* types involved in the expression: 
- Expressions that use `type T` directly with no other types. 
- Expressions that use `type T` with exactly one other type. 
- Expressions that use `type T` with N other types. 
This task refines the layered usage reporting by providing a more granular view of type interactions and dependencies."
