title = "Implement Lattice Placement Logic"
description = "Implement the logic for determining a function's optimal Lattice placement. This involves: (1) performing a Level 0 check based on `CargoDetails` and `RustDetails` to identify functions exclusively referencing primitives or internal `prelude` items, and (2) for non-Level 0 functions, identifying all referenced external identifiers (from the Bag of Words report) to determine the optimal 8D coordinate grouping (targeting ~4KB size)."
