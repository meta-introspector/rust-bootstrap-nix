title = "Determine Test Types and Tools"
description = "Unit Tests: Leverage Rust's built-in `cargo test` for individual functions and modules, especially within `bootstrap-config-builder` and the refactored `standalonex/src/bootstrap/src/lib.rs` components. Integration Tests: Rust-Nix Interaction: Write Rust tests that call the Nix interaction logic and assert on the outcomes (e.g., correct Nix command execution, valid path resolution). Component Interaction: Test the flow between `bootstrap-config-builder` and the main Rust bootstrap process. System/End-to-End Tests: Shell Scripts: Create or enhance existing shell scripts (`test.sh`, `run_bootstrap_test.sh`, etc.) to execute the full bootstrap process and verify the final output (e.g., successful compilation, correct artifacts). Nix Checks: Use `nix-build --check` and potentially `nix-diff` to ensure flake outputs are consistent and correct. Static Analysis & Linting: Ensure pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) are comprehensive and run regularly. This includes `rustfmt`, `clippy`, and potentially `shellcheck` for shell scripts. `rust-system-composer` Generated Projects: Successfully compiled generated projects, confirming correctness of generated `Cargo.toml`, `lib.rs`, and extracted declarations. Documentation Review: Regularly verify that `docs/` accurately reflects the current state and functionality of the project."
