title = "Extract syn Usage into syn Lattice"
description = "Extract all usages of the `syn` crate within the codebase and organize them into a dedicated 'syn lattice'. This involves identifying all `syn` related types, functions, and macros, and mapping their dependencies to form a structured representation within our lattice system. This is a crucial step for self-bootstrapping and understanding the compiler's internal structure."
