description = "Mandate that consumption and modification of core types like `GitInfo`, `NixInfo`, `FunctionInfo`, and `AstStatistics` occur via their associated traits (`GitInfoTrait`, `NixInfoTrait`, etc.). This ensures that implementation details (struct fields) are decoupled from the API contract (trait methods), enforcing the principle of decoupling API types using traits."
