description = "Implement the functionality to generate TOML files (or Parquet, if applicable) containing the canonical definition, Level assignment, and the identified Bag of Words/Coordinates for processed functions. This structured definition will be consumed by `rust-decl-splitter` to ensure functions are split and stored in the correct layer within the `generated_declarations/` hierarchy."
