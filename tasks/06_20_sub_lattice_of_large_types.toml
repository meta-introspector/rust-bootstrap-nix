title = "Sub-Lattice of Large Enums, Structs, and Functions"
description = "Document the concept and implementation strategy for treating large enums, structs, and functions as sub-lattices. This involves analyzing their internal components (fields, variants, parameters, methods within `impl` blocks) as nodes and their co-occurrence or dependencies as edges, forming new, finer-grained lattices. This concept is detailed in `Lattice_Analysis_for_Large_Types.md` and is crucial for decomposing complex types into manageable, interconnected components within the overall lattice system."
