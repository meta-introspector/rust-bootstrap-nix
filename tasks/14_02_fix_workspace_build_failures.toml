description = """
This task addresses a build failure caused by including `src/level_00` as a workspace member in the root `Cargo.toml`. The `src/level_00` directory contains generated code and does not have its own `Cargo.toml`, leading to build errors. The fix involves removing this directory from the workspace members.
