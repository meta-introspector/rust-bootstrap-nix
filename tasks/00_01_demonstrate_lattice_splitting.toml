title = "Demonstrate Lattice Splitting of a Large Function"
description = """
This task aims to demonstrate the automatic splitting of a large, monolithic Rust function into smaller, lattice-structured chunks using our tools. This will serve as a concrete example of the "fungal consumption" approach, showcasing how a complex piece of code can be decomposed and reorganized according to our lattice system principles.

The process will involve:
- Identifying a suitable large Rust function (e.g., a complex algorithm or a core processing loop).
- Using `expanded-code-collector` to obtain its expanded form.
- Applying `split-expanded-bin` to analyze its internal dependencies and extract canonical declarations.
- Visualizing the resulting lattice structure of the function's components.
- Generating a new, modularized version of the function based on the lattice.
