title = "Refactor rust-system-composer to use Monadic I/O"
description = "Prioritize implementation of Monadic I/O Traits (specifically `Monad`, `Applicative`, and `Arrow` traits defined in `monadic-io-traits`). Refactor `rust-system-composer`'s I/O operations (file reading, writing, external command execution) to use this monadic pattern, ensuring that side effects are controlled and explicitly sequenced. The `Arrow` trait is specifically designed for function composition (`compose`) and execution (`call`), providing a clean abstraction layer for managing the flow of asynchronous operations in the system's architecture."
