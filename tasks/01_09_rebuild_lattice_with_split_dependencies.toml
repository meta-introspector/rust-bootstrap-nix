notes = "Merged split-expanded-bin functionality into prelude-generator. Refactored extract_declarations_for_composer to use a new argument type (DeclarationExtractionArgs). Updated rust-system-composer to utilize the refactored prelude-generator function. All compilation errors resolved. Awaiting QA."
