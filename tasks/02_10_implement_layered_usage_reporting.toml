title = "Implement Layered Usage Reporting and Analysis"
description = "Implement a sophisticated reporting and analysis mechanism for collected usage data. This involves: 
- Aggregating usage information into a single object, tracking dependencies up to a depth of 8. 
- Generating reports that present the usage data as a tree structure, with clear distinctions and splitting by type, including the type of AST node (e.g., `type A`, `expression type`, `other types B`). 
- Ordering the reported usage from simple to complex, including counts for each item. 
- Providing layered reports that show usage at different depths, up to 8 layers deep. This task builds upon the 'bag of words' and declaration grouping mechanisms to provide actionable insights into the codebase structure."
