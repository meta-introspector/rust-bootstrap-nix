title = "Recreate Rust Compiler with Lattice System (Fungal Consumption)"
description = """
The long-term goal of this project is to incrementally recreate the Rust compiler from scratch using our lattice system. This process will involve a "fungal consumption" approach, where the lattice system will slowly consume and break down the existing Rust compiler's components, replacing them with our own modular, lattice-structured implementations.

This task encompasses the entire journey of:
- Decomposing the Rust compiler's AST, HIR, MIR, and other intermediate representations.
- Extracting canonical declarations and their dependencies.
- Building a hierarchical lattice of functions and types.
- Implementing precondition checks and rich metadata extraction.
- Generating a global symbol table.
- Ultimately, self-hosting and replacing parts of the Rust toolchain with our lattice-based system.
