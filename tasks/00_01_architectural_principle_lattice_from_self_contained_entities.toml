title = "Architectural Principle: Lattice of Modules and Flakes from Self-Contained Entities"
description = "Document the architectural principle of creating a lattice of modules and flakes based on a single existing type or module, such as the Rust compiler itself. This principle recognizes that entities like Rust are 'self-describing and self-contained monsters,' and their internal structure can inform the construction of a higher-level lattice representing inter-module dependencies and flake relationships. This task emphasizes the foundational idea that even complex, monolithic systems can be decomposed and re-represented within our lattice framework."
