description = "This executes the large-scale splitting using `rust-decl-splitter` to break the rest of the monolithic files into **single declaration units**. This process creates the comprehensive set of individual **\"nodes\"** (Level 1+) needed for the full topological sort, where their dependencies (mapped via BoW in Step 2) rely on the foundational Level 0 nodes established in Step 3."
