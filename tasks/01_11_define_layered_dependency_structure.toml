title = "Define Layered Dependency Structure"
description = """Implement a hierarchical dependency structure where Layer 1 depends solely on Layer 0, and subsequent layers (up to Layer 8 maximum) depend on all public items from preceding layers. This ensures a controlled and auditable dependency graph.

Recent analysis indicates that the Rust compiler (`rustc`) currently exhibits 31 dependency layers. This fits within our proposed 8D space folding scheme, where levels can be hard-capped at 64 or 128. The 31 layers of `rustc` can either be broken into a cycle of 8 or mapped down into the folded 8D space. We will leverage the Minizinc solver (as outlined in task `03_24_execute_minizinc_solver.toml`) with our collected data to determine the optimal mapping that satisfies all constraints.
