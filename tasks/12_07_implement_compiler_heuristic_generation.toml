title = "Implement Compiler Heuristic Generation and Application"
description = "Implement the mechanism for generating, committing, and applying updated heuristics for the `ClassifyUsesFunctor`. If the LLM generates an updated heuristic (from Phase 2 analysis), this heuristic will be committed as a raw string or a structured data type and then used by the `prelude-generator` to refine its own logic, thereby achieving the self-hosting/self-generation goal outlined in `bootstrap.md`."
